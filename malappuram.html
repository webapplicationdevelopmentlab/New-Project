                        They held great importance to the locals of Kerala and thus, had this shrine dedicated to them. A local festival held here during the time of Muharram is one of the primary attractions of this place.<br>

Keralam Kundu Waterfalls are undoubtedly the best of all Malappuram Tourist Places, and that is why people keep flocking here to have an experience of the mystical. 

                        The water flows in from the forest of the western ghat and forms a pool of crystal clear water at the base of the falls. Also, it is believed that the water has many medicinal properties.

                            Arimbra Hills or Mini Ooty is one of the most scenic places to visit in Malappuram. The place is called mini Ooty because of its resemblance to the hill station of the same name, and a rather famous one at that. 

Located at a height of about 1,050 feet above sea level, you can get a breathtaking view of the area around. Not just that, on the top of the hill, you can get to see a number of stone crushers, plantations, and a few Jain temples as well.
